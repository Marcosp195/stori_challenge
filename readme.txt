# Contigo Credit Products Case Study

This project analyzes the financial performance of two credit products (Contigo A and Contigo B) and evaluates the impact of a collections phone campaign on delinquent Contigo A customers. The goal is to assess overall profitability and recommend a sustainable strategy.

This project demonstrates the ability to:
* Build a forward-looking financial forecast.
* Analyze loan performance, delinquency, and unit economics.
* Evaluate intervention strategies using data-driven KPIs.
