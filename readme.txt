# Contigo Credit Products Case Study

This project evaluates the financial performance of two credit products (Contigo A and Contigo B) and analyzes the impact of a phone-based collections campaign on delinquent Contigo A customers. The goal is to determine profitability and recommend a sustainable growth and collections strategy.

This project demonstrates the ability to:
* Build forward-looking revenue and loss models.
* Analyze loan delinquency, unit economics, and recovery outcomes.
* Translate financial insights into strategic recommendations.

## The Challenge

The case study was structured in two parts:

Objectives:
1. Create a 12-month financial model projecting customer growth, revenue, delinquency losses, and costs for Contigo A and Contigo B.
2. Evaluate the financial impact of a collections call campaign on delinquent Contigo A customers.
3. Recommend a more sustainable, profitability-focused strategy.
