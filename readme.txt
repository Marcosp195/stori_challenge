# Contigo Credit Products Case Study

This project analyzes the financial performance of two credit products (Contigo A and Contigo B) and evaluates the impact of a targeted collections call campaign on delinquent customers. The goal is to assess profitability and recommend a sustainable growth and collections strategy.

This project demonstrates the ability to:
* Build a 12-month financial forecast model.
* Analyze loan performance and delinquency-driven losses.
* Evaluate operational initiatives using data-driven KPIs.

## The Challenge

The case study is divided into two core components:

Objectives:
1. Create a forward-looking financial model projecting customer growth, revenue, losses, and profitability for two credit products.
2. Analyze the impact of a debt collections phone campaign for Contigo A customers.
3. Recommend strategic actions to support sustainable profitability.

## My Solution & Key Files

### 1. Technical Analysis Notebook: `ba_hiring_project.ipynb`
* Built a 12-month financial forecast for Contigo A & Contigo B.
* Modeled customer growth, revenue, delinquency losses, and cost structure.
* Analyzed performance with and without the collections campaign.
* Calculated recovery rates, unit economics, and ROI of the phone campaign.
* Provided data-driven recommendations to shift from aggressive growth to sustainable profitability.

### 2. Data / Input File
* `BA Hiring - Collections Challenge.csv`

This dataset includes customer-level information needed to model receivables performance and collections outcomes.

## How to Run

### Requirements
* Python 3.8 or higher  
* Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter Lab or VS Code with notebook support)

### Install Dependencies
pip install pandas matplotlib pandasql


### Execute
1. Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the notebook.
2. Open `ba_hiring_project.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells in sequence — the notebook is fully self-contained.

## Summary of Key Findings

* The current growth strategy is **not sustainable** — Contigo A’s losses increase over time.
* The **collections phone campaign** improves recovery and turns Contigo A from a loss into a modest profit.
* Recommended strategic shift: move from **growth at all costs** to sustainable profitability by:
  - Continuing the collections campaign
  - Adjusting risk/pricing for Contigo A
  - Prioritizing growth of Contigo B
