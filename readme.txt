Challenge Overview

This case study has two parts:

Part 1 - Business Analysis:
Create a 12-month financial forecast for a startup with two credit products (Contigo A & Contigo B). The model projects customer growth, revenue, delinquency losses, and costs to assess overall profitability.

Part 2 - Collections Strategy:
Analyze the impact of a phone call campaign to recover debt from delinquent Contigo A customers. Estimate key KPIs, compare results with and without the campaign, and suggest improvements.

How to Run

Requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher

Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter Lab or VS Code with Python/Jupyter extension)

Dependencies: pandas, matplotlib, pandasql
Install with:
pip install pandas matplotlib pandasql

Run the Notebook:

Clone or download this repository.

Make sure the file “BA Hiring - Collections Challenge.csv” is in the same folder as the notebook.

Open “ba_hiring_project.ipynb” in your Jupyter environment.

Run all cells in order. The notebook is self-contained and includes all steps from data cleaning to final recommendations.

Summary of Findings

The current growth strategy is unsustainable; Contigo A drives rising losses.

The collections campaign turns Contigo A from a loss into a modest profit.

Recommended next step: shift from “growth at all costs” to sustainable profitability by running the campaign, adjusting risk and pricing, and focusing growth on Contigo B.
